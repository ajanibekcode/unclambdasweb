## Workflow Structure
To ensure smooth collaboration and maintain code quality, please follow this workflow structure:

### Branching Strategy
- **`main` branch**: Contains stable, production-ready code.
- **Semester branches**: Developers will create a new branch at the beginning of each semester (e.g., `spring25` or `fall24`) to contain all updates for that semester.
- **Feature branches**: Use feature-specific branches within the semester branch (e.g., `spring25/events`) for new features.

### Pull Requests
1. Before creating a PR:
   - Ensure your changes are thoroughly tested.
   - Follow the code style guidelines and ensure linting passes.
2. When creating a PR:
   - Provide a clear description of the changes made.
   - Link related issues or features using keywords (e.g., `Closes #123`).
   - Request at least one reviewer from the team.
3. Merging PRs:
   - Ensure all checks (e.g., CI/CD, code review) are passed.
